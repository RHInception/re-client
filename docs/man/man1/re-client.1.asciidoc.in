NAME
----
re-client - Client utility for the Release Engine

SYNOPSIS
--------
re-client [-h] [-d] [-p PROJECT] [-i ID]

DESCRIPTION
----------
Utilities for interacting with the Release Engine. Supports creating,
reading, updating, and deleting playbooks.

OPTIONS
-------
*-h*, *--help*::
Show the help message

*-d*, *--debug*::
Enable debugging output

*-p* 'PROJECT', *--project*='PROJECT'::
Set default 'PROJECT'

*-i* 'ID', *--id*='ID'::
Set default playbook 'ID'

*-f* 'yaml/json', *--format*='yaml/json'::
Define the format to use. Default: yaml

COMMANDS
--------
Launching *re-client* brings you into a command prompt. There are
several options to select from, they are self-explanatory:

    0) Get all playbooks ever
    1) Get all playbooks for a project
    2) Get a single playbook for a project
    3) Update a playbook
    4) Delete a playbook
    5) Create a new playbook
    6) Start a deployment (without dynamic variables)
    7) Quit


The *re-client* prompt is *readline* enabled. This means it supports
line editing and command history if your platform has *readline*
support.

The 'Get' commands display the requested documents in *less*. The
'Update' and 'Create' commands launch an editor. First the *VISUAL*
variable is checked, followed by the *EDITOR* variable. If neither is
defined in your environment then the selected editor defaults to
*emacs*. You can set this permenantly to something else by exporting
*VISUAL* or *EDITOR* in your shell rc file:

    # ~/.bashrc
    export VISUAL=nano
    export EDITOR=nano
